Ever realised you eat too much, like to eat out, constantly spend money and grub and always exploring food?  Us too so we decided to make a food blog after going to a shipping container one lunch time and critiquing value for money.

What did we eat that fateful day?  Well we'd decided to go see who'd occupied our favourite Karaage Chicken vendors spot and see what they had to offer.

I'm a sucker for a rice bowl and got the beef rice bowl and Zack got the wrap, gyoza and something else.  The beef was absolutely stunning but overall value for money wasn't there so we groaned about it and decided to start this site.

A short intro but that's how we got here, we hope you enjoy the ride.  

**Please note:** The picture is my own food, not bought, I'll post the recipe very very soon.
